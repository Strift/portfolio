# On Revenge bedtime procrastination

<span class="article-date">April 4th, 2021</span>

Tupac Shakur claimed that "revenge is like the sweetest joy" next to the pleasures of the flesh. But pursuing revenge is often deemed self-destructive. And guess what â€” revenge bedtime procrastination is no different.

Bedtime procrastination is a person's **attempt to have control over their time at night**. This stems from a perception of lacking influence over events during the day. It became **associated with revenge after the phenomenon grew in visibility in China**. [Employees working the infamous 996](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201123-the-psychology-behind-revenge-bedtime-procrastination) felt that employers were stealing their time. They got revenge by stealing it back at night.

For [Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/revenge-bedtime-procrastination), revenge bedtime procrastination is "a response to extended work hours that, if combined with a full night's sleep, leave virtually no time for entertainment or relaxation."

That spoke very much to me. And so do the behaviors associated with this psychological concept:
- Having no actual reason to stay up late,
- Delaying sleep, thus reducing total sleep time,
- Being aware of the negative consequences induced by that delay, and
- Procrastination-related behaviors (it's not to do chores that I'd say up late).

The scientific debate is still ongoing. At the moment, **possible explanations include having a different chronotype or lacking self-control**. Simply put, the former is the case of a _Night Owl_ being forced into an _Early Bird_ lifestyle because of work. But I'm most intrigued by the latter.

Because a busy work day is demanding in terms of self-control, our self-control is at the lowest at the end of the day. As a result, it is easier to get tempted and slip into unhealthy habits at night. [Research shows](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29662459/) that taxing days make us more likely to engage in bedtime procrastination.

The consequences of sleep deprivation are clear. It degrades thinking, memory, and decision-making. It can lead to depression and anxiety. It also generally worsens physical health. That's scary enough.

But here's why I find it intriguing. If low self-regulation induces sleep procrastination, it can become part of a vicious circle. A cycle of reduced sleep and worse overall health is unlikely to result in more self-control.

And a lack of self-control will hardly translate into a healthier lifestyleâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhether or not you're working 996.
