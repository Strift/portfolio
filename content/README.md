# Esports and Internet hustling

Hey, my name is Laurent Cazanove. People online may know me as Strift.

I am currently working as Esports Data Manager at Pandascore. I sometimes happen to work as a freelance teacher or web developer. One day, I'd like to publish an interactive novel.

Outside of esports or gaming-related activities, I enjoy medieval history, chinese food and rap music.
