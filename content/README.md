# Esports and Internet hustling

Hey, my name is Laurent Cazanove but people online just call me Strift.

I am currently working as **Customer Success & DX Engineer** at Pandascore.  I sometimes happen to work as a freelance teacher or web developer. One day, I'd like to publish an interactive novel.

Outside of esports or gaming-related activities, I enjoy medieval history, chinese food and rap music.
