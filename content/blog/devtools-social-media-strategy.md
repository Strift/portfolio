# Thoughts on social media strategy for dev tools

You’re not competing with other products. You’re competing for attention.

**You're competing against cat GIFs and ragebaits.**

People are _not_ going to stop doomscrolling and randomly sign up for a product trial. So before marketing to them, let's start with stopping the scroll and engaging them.

Because of this, I mainly see social medias as a way to build brand awareness. You want to create touchpoints with your ICP.

Somewhere down the line, one of these posts will spark enough curiosity for readers to want to know more and visit your website.

But before that, you need to generate curiosity. So you need to create content that matches the users’ expectations on the platform and adhere to its ”meta”. There is no shortcut around this.

X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn have become more like Reddit and Hackernews in a sense. Your followers matter less. Your content now needs to pass a “relevance test” before others can see it.

If you want to grow your website traffic, simply posting links to your blog won't do it. Especially now that the algorithms downrank posts with external links.

To reach your ICP, you need to create content that’s relevant to platform audience. Only by doing so can you build awareness of your product.

Eventually, a part of this audience will start converting to your website and product. It is still possible to acquire traffic via social medias. Especially when your content goes viral. But it’s harder now than before.
