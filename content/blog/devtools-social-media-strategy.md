# Thoughts on social media strategy for dev tools

You’re not competing with other products. You’re competing for attention.

People are not scrolling on social media and randomly going to sign up for a product trial.

So before marketing to them, you want to engage them. You want to build brand awareness and create multiple touchpoints with your ICP. Eventually, one of your posts will spark enough curiosity for readers to want to know more and visit your website.

But before that, you need to engage them. So you need to create content that matches the users’ expectations on the platform and adhere to its best practices. There is no shortcut to that.

X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn have become more like Reddit and Hackernews. Even with massive followings, your content needs to pass a “relevance test” before others can see it. Especially now that their algorithms now downrank posts with external links.

If you want to grow your website traffic, the time of simply posting links to your blog is over. To reach your audience, you need to create content that’s relevant to the audience on the platform.

By doing so, you build awareness of your product and brand. Eventually, a part of this audience will start converting to your website and product. It is possible to acquire traffic via these platforms. Especially if your content goes viral, or really makes a hit. But it’s harder now than before.
