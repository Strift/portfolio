# Why Taiwan, why now?

I often get ask, why did I decide to move to Taiwan? The truth is as I approached 30, I started fearing one thing: what if I _never_ lived abroad?

I always [loved learning languages](/blog/arrete-de-parler-franglais). As I learned the words and discovered new expressions, it felt like opening a window into a new culture. And I always thought living abroad was the best way to experience foreign culture. A deep dive into the culture itself.

It had always been my dream, and yet, after 12 years in Paris, I hadn’t taken the leap. Life in Paris was comfortable—maybe too comfortable? I started fearing that if I didn’t do it now, I might regret it forever.

Now was a good time. After all, I had no property or financial ties holding me back. I’d finally paid off my student loans and even saved a little. If I didn’t dare now, then when would I?

Taking the leap still felt scary. I had a dream job at Meilisearch, a strong social life, and a million little habits tied to Paris. My family was in France, and leaving felt like stepping into the unknown. It wasn’t an easy decision. I remember thinking this through for hours [last December](/blog/2023#december).

That’s when I turned to one of Jeff Bezos’ mental models, the [regret minimization framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ). If I were 80 years old and couldn’t do this experience anymore because of physical or mental inaptitude, what would I regret more?

Leaving Paris for a while, or staying in my comfort and not giving my dream a shot?

When looked at through this lens, the choice was obvious. So, the decision was made: I would start planning to make this dream a reality.

But why Taiwan?

Well, this is another story. One about how following your curiosity can take you to unexpected places and lead to fascinating journeys.

It all began in Paris, at an exhibition in the winter of 2021:
