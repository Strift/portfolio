# Writing your first freelance contract

Need a freelance contract but canâ€™t afford a lawyer? Hereâ€™s how you can use ChatGPT to help you.

> This isnâ€™t as reliable as consulting a lawyer. But itâ€™s a helpful DIY solution if you're on your own.

A solid contract protects both you and your clients. Thanks to AI, itâ€™s now easier to make one than you might think, even if you don't have a lawyer. Here's a short guide to help you get started:

## 1. Get an example template

There are different ways to get a example contract. I would recommend:
- Asking a freelancer in your field for an example
- Asking the company you're working with (they may have worked with other freelancers)
- Googling it: there are most likely tons of examples, and probaly some related to your field

## 2. Write down some bullet points covering the essentials

These are usually the things you already discussed with your client, like:
- The tasks and missions you agreed upon
- The invoicing and payment terms

## 3. Use a GPT trained in your legal system

For French law, I used [LÃ©giGPT](https://legigpt.fr/) (I personally used the GPT available via ChatGPT, so I don't know if the site works a 100% similarly.) Make sure to use a GPT trained on the laws in your country.

This is the important part. Avoid using a generic GPT which might hallucinate laws. ðŸ™ƒ

## 4. Redact the contract

Feed the GPT the list of bullet points you wrote earlier and ask it to generate a draft contract based on that.

## 5. Sanity check the structure with the real thing

After the GPT gives you a contract, compare it with your example contract. This will help you identify potentially missing sections. If needed, ask it to update the contract to add the missing sections.

## 6. Refine and polish

After you're satisfied with the general structure of the contract, refine the specific sections and paragraphs:
- Add anything you think is missing (write it in plain language, and have GPT rephrase in the proper legal terms)
- Use GPT again to refine unclear sections

## 7. Review multiple times

Finally, review the contract to make sure it is protecting you, and providing all the security your client needs to work with you:
- Create separate GPT conversations (to get separate contexts) to review the final document
- Look for recurring feedback; and consider if you should ignore the one-offs suggestions

Once youâ€™re satisfied with the result and donâ€™t receive actionable feedback anymore, youâ€™re good to go!
