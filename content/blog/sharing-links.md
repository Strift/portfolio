I work in software engineering, and there is always a lot of industry news to keep up with. I found it's generally helpful to share what we have learned with colleagues, as it makes it easier for everyone to stay on top of things.

But too often, people share links in Slack without much comment. This has always been frustrating for me. In this age of information overload, sharing a link without so much as a TL;DR isn't helpful to me.

**If anything, I know have _more_ information to navigate, not less.**

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s asking too much, but when someone shares a link, I expect them to tell me why it's interesting. (Also looking at you, my friendsâ€”dropping random YouTube links in my DMs!)

Just a one-liner is already taking us a long way. Iâ€™ve always found it a bit sad, especially since the person sharing the link just read the article (or watched the video.)

Now, I understand that people arenâ€™t always going to go this extra mile when sharing memes. But when it comes to work-related matters, I think itâ€™s even more detrimental.

Hereâ€™s why I think we should include TL;DRs when sharing links:

1. Share our reader perspective: let others know _why_ you think this is worth their time
2. Help others gain time: help them skim through lengthy content by highlighting the interesting bits

In my previous companies, I tried different approaches to help with this. One was to build a shared reading list in Notion. However, the overhead became painful, and people quit sharing links altogether.

I decided to rethink my approach to solving this problem. I will now be using [Scriv](https://scriv.co?ref=laurentcazanove.com), an app and browser extension (that Iâ€™m building myself ðŸ¥³). Scriv allows commenting on any web page and bookmarking them. It's like a web clipper but with collaboration features baked in.

Iâ€™m excited to hear what you have to say about Scriv!

In the meantime, I'm curious to hear if others have encountered the same issues. How do you solve them? Use the social links below to get in touch!
