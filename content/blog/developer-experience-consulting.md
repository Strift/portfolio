# Launching my Developer Experience consulting business ðŸš€

After years of contributing to developer experience at trailblazing companies like [Meilisearch](https://meilisearch.com?ref=laurentcazanove.com), [TwicPics](https://twicpics.com?ref=laurentcazanove.com), and [PandaScore](https://pandascore.co?ref=laurentcazanove.com), Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the launch of my **Developer Experience** consulting business.

## Focus on Developer Experience

When building dev tools, high-quality educational resources and product copy are key factors to drive developer adoption, retention, and advocacy.

My mission is to help your company deliver exceptional experiences that resonate with app builders.

## What I bring to the table

With [prior experiences](/portfolio) in full-stack web development and copywriting, I bridge the gap between technical precision and clear, engaging communication.

I work closely with DevRel, Product Marketing, and Engineering teams to deliver:
- **Technical writing & Docs UX**: Enabling scalable developer learning and success
- **Copywriting**: Engaging content for top-of-funnel attraction and bottom-of-funnel conversion
- **Starter kits & SDK development**: Helping developers get to their â€˜ahaâ€™ moment in minutes, not days
- **Support & community management**: Driving brand recognition and advocacy through authentic developer relationships

## Letâ€™s build together?

Iâ€™m open for fractional clients and one-off projects. If your company is looking to create exceptional experiences for app builders, letâ€™s chat!
