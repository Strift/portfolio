# Learning to let go

I'm an all-or-nothing person. So whenever I commit to something, it's hard for me to just let go.

Like this advent calendar thing. I committed to writing a blog post a day. So it's hard for me to imagine not publishing a post.

I would think, “I failed.” I know that's just the wrong way to look at it. It's seeing the half-empty glass. But it's what first comes to my mind.

I'm doing this to get in the habit of publishing more often. The benefit is for me.

But sometimes life gets in the way—and that's fine.

Today, I spent a great night at the bar in Kaohsiung (高雄) with the people I met during **HackerHouse Taiwan** (I'll tell you more in another post.)

I tried to pull out my laptop to write the blog at the bar, but it just felt wrong. I wanted to be fully present in the moment, and enjoy my time with people I might not be able to see everyday. So I decided that it would be okay if I didn't publish a blog post today.

But hey, I ended up writing this in the end. So, yeah...

I'm trying to learn to let go.
