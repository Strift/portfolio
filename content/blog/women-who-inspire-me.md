# A shoutout to the women who inspire me

I meant to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8—but life happened. Still, who says you need a specific day to shout out the kick-ass girls around us?

Here's to them.

## Efjee ‘Sjokz’ Deportere

She's the face of League of Legends esports broadcasts. She gets the culture so right, and her stellar hosting and interviewing skills are a treat to any broadcast she works. Although she started as a writer and shyly transitioned to on-camera work, she has now become a role model and standard to match for everyone in the industry.

## Cassidy Williams

I started following her a while ago and always loved the humble way she writes and talks. She makes you feel that being nerdy is okay. She's somewhat famous in the tech industry now, but it doesn't feel like she lost touch. Her content kept the same geeky, weird, sincere, and humble vibe.

## Sarah Drasner

When I wanted to work in Developer Experience, I learned a lot about the field from her writing. I like the positivity and inclusiveness she brings to the tech space, openly taking stances regarding societal issues. I love that she dares to be open about her personal struggles because it makes her story relatable.

## Kaleigh Moore

I discovered her at an important moment in my life when [I wanted to become a writer](/blog/my-commitment-to-writing). She's a freelance writer and one of the few professionals whose blog and newsletter I consistently read. Her advice and guides were foundational in helping me learn to write—which played a big role in taking me where I am in life now. I'm grateful for her content.

## J.K. Rowling

Yes, I know. But I'm not a revisionist. And pretending she didn't have a massive impact on me would be dishonest. First through her humorous, inspired, and relatable writing—and later through her Harvard speech on imagination and empathy. The speech was somewhat of a revelation to me and still inspires me to this day.

## Anne-Laure Le Cunff

She's a former tech girl turned neuroscientist who writes about creativity, wellness, and mindful productivity—all themes that [resonate with me](/blog/advent-of-blog-lessons). So, reading her work is always a treat. I'm glad to see her winning with the release of her 'Tiny Experiments' book. She's a motivation for me to trust my English skills as a non-native speaker.
