# Can I really do this?

<span class="article-date">March 25th, 2021</span>

I like trains. Once they’re on the right track, they just run straight to their destination. Me… Not so much. Often, I’ll set out to *start doing things* — reading, exercising, you name it. Missing my goals a few times will shake my confidence. But miss more, and the fear of failure will start getting to me. Yesterday was one of those moments.

**I was disappointed in myself.** For fourteen days now, I’ve been trying to build a daily writing habit. And yesterday was already the third time I failed to publish.

You may be thinking, *“So what, you failed to publish 3 times in a fortnight?”*

I get that it may not sound like much. But 3 out of 14 times is actually 20%. How would you feel about a co-worker missing on 20% of the deadlines? Well, you’d probably think that he or she isn’t reliable.

But here’s why I really felt bad. My goal was to build a *long-term* habit. And most often that not, my motivation is the highest at the beginning of the journey. It decreases after that. Was I already on the decline?

Would I add “writing daily” to the list of things I left unfinished?

Nope. Not this time. I know how important this is to me. I already see results.

Okay — the motivation seems to be there. So how could I engineer my way to successfully building this habit?

Let’s start with the basics. **When something is not working**, we need to find the points of friction — **find what makes it hard to do.** After all, when things are easy, there’s less chance we fail to do them, right? So *what* brought me *not* to write on those days?

I reckon there was a mix of two things:
- Breaking my routine and not writing in the morning
- Not having topics ideas (that I think worth sharing)

Good — now I have clues on what I need to tackle. First, I need to schedule my time and design my environment to make sure I can write in the morning. And secondly, I need to come up with ways to generate new, and probably more, ideas.

Both of these topics could be articles of their own, so I will not linger — let me know if you’re interested though! But the key thing was: I found my points of friction. And this gave me objectives to work towards; **I had a plan to help me build my daily habit.**

Suddenly, I wasn’t fearing failure just as much. Now that I had a plan — a list of specific things to do — I was way less worried about the possibility of failure. Having a plan made me feel like *I* was in control. It was reassuring.

**Preparation boosts confidence; and confidence helps fighting fear**. To be honest, becoming a writer still feels like I have a mountain to climb. But at least now I know the route for a couple stages ahead. Onward — the journey continues!
