My name is **Laurent Cazanove**. People online just call me Strift.

I am currently working as **Developer Advocate** at TwicPics.

Before this, I spent the recent years:
- helping developers to use PandaScore's esports stats API,
- boostrapping a 25-person international remote team, and
- [writing](/articles/) and [coding](/projects)
