<!-- ## ðŸ‘‹ About me -->

I'm Laurent, but people online call me Strift. I'm a **freelance developer experience engineer**.

I help dev tools build great onboarding experiences. My primary skills are **technical writing**, **UX writing**, and **full-stack development**.

I have openings for fractional clients and one-off projects starting in 2025.
