The classifier for rooms is 間 _jiān_.

<!--more-->

In Mandarin, counting items require using a measure word (also called **classifier**) after numbers. Depending on _what_ you're counting, the measure word is different. To count rooms, i.e. inside a building or house, the classifier is 間 _jiān_.

**Examples**

- 我家有兩間房間 _Wǒjiā yǒu liǎng jiān fángjiān._ <br>
There are two rooms in my house.
