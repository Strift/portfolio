In Mandarin, modifier words always come _before_ the word they modify.

<!--more-->

Modifier words notably include adverbs, adjective, and possessives.

Consider these English examples:
- the _red_ car — "red" is a modifier of "car"
- eat _slowly_ — "slowly" is a modifier of "eat"

In English, modifiers can be found both before and after the subject they modify. In Mandarin, they always come before.

- 台灣的水果
- 慢慢來
- 紅茶
- 我最喜歡吃的台灣的水果是芒果
