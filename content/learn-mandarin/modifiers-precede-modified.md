# Modifiers precede modified

In Mandarin, modifier words always come _before_ the word they modify.

<!--more-->

Modifiers include adverbs, adjective, or possessives.

For example,

"the red car", red is a modifier of car
"eat slowly", slowly is a modifier of eat
In English, they can be found sometimes before, sometimes after the subject they modify.

In Mandarin, they are always before.
